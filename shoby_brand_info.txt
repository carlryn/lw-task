#### **Science Behind the Cold Pad Technology™**

The science behind Shoby’s Cold Pad Technology™ is a testament to our commitment to innovation and comfort. This technology is based on advanced materials engineering and thermodynamics, enabling us to create a cooling solution that is both effective and practical for everyday use.

The cold pads are made from a specially designed phase change material (PCM), which can store and release large amounts of energy as it changes from one phase (solid) to another (liquid). When the cold pads are placed in the freezer, the PCM solidifies, storing energy as latent heat. Once reinserted into the shoes, the PCM absorbs heat from your feet, gradually melting and releasing the stored energy as a cooling sensation. This process can provide several hours of cooling relief, depending on the ambient temperature and the wearer's level of activity.

One of PCM’s key benefits is its ability to maintain a consistent temperature for an extended period. Unlike traditional cooling methods, which can result in a rapid drop in temperature followed by a quick return to normal, PCM provides a sustained cooling effect that keeps your feet comfortable for longer. Additionally, the materials used in the cold pads are lightweight and flexible, ensuring they do not interfere with the fit or comfort of the shoes.

The Cold Pad Technology™ is also designed for ease of use. The cold pads can be easily removed and reinserted into the shoes, allowing for quick and hassle-free recharging. This convenience makes it simple to incorporate Cold Pad Technology™ into your daily routine, providing comfort and relief whenever needed.
